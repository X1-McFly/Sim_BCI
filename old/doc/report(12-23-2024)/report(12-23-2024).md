## **1. Project Goal**
With industry-leading 8- and 16-channel EEG monitoring devices retailing for upwards of \$2,000 and \$3,500, respectively, there is a growing need for affordable, entry-level alternatives as the BCI market continues to expand. The Quron Project builds on well-documented hardware and aims to provide a cost-effective, open-source solution, making neuroscience education more accessible for individual makers, students, and university programs. Beyond education, the project also seeks to develop a commercial option that balances affordability with high performance, while driving innovative applications for BCIs, such as mind-controlled systems in automotive technology, immersive VR/XR platforms, and neurorehabilitation tools.
