The brain consists of 3 major components:
	
	_Cerebrum--the largest part of the brain with gray 
	matter on the outside, where the sulci resides, and
	white matter on the inside.

	_Cerebellum--Coordinates voluntary muscle movements
	and maintains subconscious physical functions.

	_Brainstem--Connects the cerebrum with the spinal
	cord.

The Cerebrum and its major components:
	
	_Frontal Lobe--Located in the front of the brain,
	being the largest lobe, the frontal lobe is 
	involved in:
		-Personality Characteristics
		-Decision-Making
		-Movement
		-Smell
		-Speech (Broca's Area)
	
	_Parietal Lobe--Located in the middle of the brain.
	The parietal lobe is involved in:
		-Spatial Relationships
		-Pain/Sense of touch
		-Language (Wernicke's area)

	_Occipital Lobe--The occipital lobe is located in
	the back of the brain and is involved with vision

	_Temporal Lobe--Located on either side of the 
	brain, the temporal lobe is involved in:
		-Short-term memory
		-Speech
		-Musical Rythm
		-Smell

Areas of Interest(Brodmann Areas or 10/20 sites):

	_Frontal Pole (FP): FPz, FP1, FP2
	Associated with executive functions, decision
	-making, and social behavior.

	_Frontal (F): F7/F8 and F3/F4
	Involved in higher cognitive functions such as 
	problem-solving, attention, and working memory

	_Central (C): C3/C4 and Cz
	These sites are linked to motor control, sensory 
	processing, and body awareness. They help 
	facilitate movement, coordination, and the 
	integration of sensory information, enabling us to 
	navigate the physical world.

	Occipital (O): O1/O2 and Oz
	O1 and O2 are associated with visual processing, 
	perception, and object recognition.
