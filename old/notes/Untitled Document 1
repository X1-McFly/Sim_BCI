FPGA:
Skills for long-term success in neuro-tech/AI
Would make it easier for commercialization over the jetson modules.
could sell the fpga design as an ASIC to biotech companies

Plug the device into a computer to train the device
One the inference of the brain signals is accurate, code it into the FPGA

design health algorithms for use on a biocomputer that periodically scans brainwaves to track mental and neural health, especially in periods of intense stimulation and adverse conditions, i.e. heightened heart rate.
