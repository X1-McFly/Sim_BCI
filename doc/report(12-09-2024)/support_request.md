# **Request for Support: FPGA Board for Brain-Computer Interface Research**

To whom it may concern,

I am writing to request support for my ongoing Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) project, specifically to acquire an FPGA board to begin gaining hands-on experience in designing custom chips for machine learning algorithms. This aligns directly with my long-term goal of advancing neurotechnology applications and developing scalable solutions for machine learning integration in BCI systems.

While I have personally invested significant funds into this research, I have exceeded my personal financial limit for this project and have not yet received the funding awarded through the Signature Experience Grant as expected. To continue progressing over the holiday break, I am seeking assistance from the EAC to provide an avenue for sustained research and skill development.

Below are a few FPGA board options that I believe would be suitable for this work (In order of preference and price):

1. Digilent Cmod A7: Breadboardable Artix-7 FPGA Module – $99.99
2. Alchitry Cu FPGA Development Board – $54.95
3. iCESugar-nano FPGA Development Board – $32.99

The EAC's support in acquiring any of these options would provide invaluable assistance in advancing this project and preparing for the next phase of development. I would be deeply grateful for your consideration and any assistance you can provide.

Thank you for your time and support.
